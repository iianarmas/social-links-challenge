## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project, I reinforced my understanding of CSS Grid and custom properties for creating a responsive, centered card layout. I also practiced implementing interactive hover and active states for better user experience.

Key techniques I implemented:

```css
.link-button:hover {
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
  color: var(--primary-grey);
  font-weight: 700;
}

.link-button:active {
  transform: scale(1.02);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on:

- Improving accessibility features
- Refining responsive design techniques
- Exploring CSS animations and transitions further
